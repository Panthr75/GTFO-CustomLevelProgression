# GTFO-CustomLevelProgression
Enables the saving of completions for rundowns (A1-A5, B1-B5, C1-C5, D1-D5, and E1-E5), and allows rundown makers to perform events (like warden text, unlocking doors, etc) through data blocks. Furthermore, there's a persistent data file so rundown developers can have level-specific states so one level affects another.
